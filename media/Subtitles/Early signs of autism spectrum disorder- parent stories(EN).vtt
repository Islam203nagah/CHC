00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
We first realized that they might be
something wrong with Kingsley when.

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.410
I was observing him
in my mother's group

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
initially i wasn't worried i just thought
he was a bit more quiet and less outgoing.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.260
But after a while probably a year i notice
that he wasn't merely meeting the same

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.760
milestones for
the of the children.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.120
Were meeting.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.770
And to be honest with you i didn't even
know what the developmental milestones were

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.500
and when they were
supposed to occur

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.490
Kingsley was..

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.770
developing and showing some.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.040
Some milestones ..,
what you call typical

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
up to about twelve months, maybe six months
later Kingsley seemed to lose the ability

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.966
to do some of those things

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:43.933
He started to speak some words.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.110
When he was one and half.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.780
And he started walking
when he was one

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.240
So he does quite well
as like other children.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.520
When he was a three.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.130
He didn't speak at all

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:03.120
so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.530
we worry about him

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.450
First we actually
thought Bailey was deaf.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.030
Because we call Bailey's nine

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.115
and he wouldn't look
at you, he wouldn't even laid on

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.827
Bailey never made a sound when he
was born he was like silent

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.447
he didn't sleep for seventeen to
eighteen hours after he was born

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:20.221
I couldn't get him to feed.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.840
He was really alert

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.670
he didn't want to be held, It was like put
me back in my little bassinet and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.690
leave me be.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
noticed that he watched a lot of movement
in rooms, like a fan moving and he would

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.600
just stare at at or he would
watch the television and..

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.250
Almost not blink

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
he wasn't.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.761
Interacting

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.770
there was real
lack of eye contact

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.270
maybe ten months old

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.640
and he laughed for two hours

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.780
like excessively in hindsight
that was probably abnormal

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:52.482
and.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.030
Had something to do with that there
was already something different about him

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
probably around

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.180
around four months.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.138
probably started noticing
different little..

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.857
subtle differences to other kids

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.285
There was a problem
with the sleeping ,there was a problem..

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.410
with he's feeding.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.270
But the rest of the time
he was a happy baby

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.830
leaving him alone
and he was happy.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
So..

00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:22.530
you sorta juggle with that is there
something wrong or is it just me

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.110
Alex was a late
talker and we thought..

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.040
Just because he was a boy and everything
and everyone talks at different ages

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.860
I actually was quiet casual
about it and at preschool.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.300
They actually suggested i get a hearing test
for Alex because he didn't seem to notice.

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:38.639
When they called his name and everything

00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:40.566
when i took Jack to one of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.640
appointments to the early childhood nurse
and she seemed a little bit more interested

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.042
in Alex and the fact that he
wasn't talking because he was two and a half

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:52.950
She actually suggested the we make an
appointment to go and get him assessed

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.190
He didn't have the typical signs, he
didn't have the flapping didn't walk on his

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.500
tippy toes or anything
like that he just ..

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.860
Was quiet.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.640
Flynn had lots
of ear infections.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.860
was constantly had glue ear, had two sets
of grommets by the time was three and half

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.730
we put..

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.313
he's non-speaking, and his lack of
communication down to constantly having glue ear

00:03:14.338 --> 00:03:17.790
The early education center was
having an information meeting about autism

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.350
halfway through it.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.490
I kind of was slinking in my
seat thinking hang on..

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.620
he does this and he does that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.770
and..

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.300
He didn't do all of the things
that they mentioned with autism.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.010
But he certainly.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.323
Did enough of them for
me to be worried.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.373
He had three other cousins
around the same age..

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:41.220
Hw'd be sitting with his
cousins a group of little

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.480
two year olds and..

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.870
That'd be..

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.150
Playing with a certain toys togather and
Jonathan would crawl away just not wanting

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.004
anything to do with the other kids.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.528
It was all starting to become.
Very realistic.
