00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.570
Eearly pregnancies quite a
dramatic time for many women.

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.390
The body changes
quite significantly

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.590
some of the most common changes
on nausea so some women can feel sick.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040
A lot of the day

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120
while we call it morning sickness
it often last much longer than that.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
Some women can feel incredibly tired and
the tiredness comes on very very suddenly.

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.520
Breast changes occur breasts can
feel larger and much more tender

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.830
and of course
there's all those mixed

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.250
mixed up emotions around
being excited and anxious and.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.690
Some women may not have been prepared
to be pregnant and they now confronting the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.880
fact that their lives
will change forever

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.680
the first three months.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.231
It's very busy with
physical changes

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.126
I think my tastes
changed alot it so..

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.580
interestingly enough

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.478
I first realized i was
pregnant i couldn't

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:50.130
I just had a really metallic
bitter taste in my mouth.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.950
The first real physical changes was..

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.990
for me where feet swelling

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.629
and in the mornings my
hands were really swollen

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680
I actually didn't have a lot of weight gain
 actually had weight loss.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.070
With him in the first
trimester i was really sick.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.190
Morning sickness afternoon sickness
midday sickness night sickness

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.480
I was just sick all the time

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.150
I think for me it was important..

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.980
You know what kind of support would be
out there for me so whether i wanted to go

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.920
public or private like that is
important for a lot of people

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.190
so for me

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.040
a big leap was..

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:27.945
Looking for appointments at hospital

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.321
like you don't really know..

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:30.775
When it'll happens what to do.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.750
the most important thing for
parents to do is to get a..

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.228
provider who they get to know
and they trust and have access to.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.490
So whether that's your midwife
or your gp or your obstetrician.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.261
Make sure you find someone
who will beyour anchor point.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.752
My first thought was to go seek help..

00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:47.786
go see a doctor

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.070
it's really important
 that my moms

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.940
and dads

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.150
both keep very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.350
fit and healthy.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.984
So first you know what's important

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.704
is obviously the big
things don't smoke.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.620
Don't drink

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.140
and eat healthily
good balance dot

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.500
regular exercise and of course
you need to you know if you're

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
not an olympic athlete don't go out
and become one during pregnancy.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.970
but you know..

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.180
a gentle walk

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.440
and you know two or three times a
week try and get some exercise

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.200
we do know that putting on a
lot of weight during pregnancy.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.250
Can lead to complications it's also
harder to lose after you've had the baby.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.945
Some of the emotional changes that i noticed
in early pregnancy where mood swings

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.832
 so you'd get

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.347
Probably a bit more moody than normal,
you know cause the influx of hormones

00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:34.510
you're  very fragile
you get offended.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.923
with like you know slight
something and you are so teary.

00:02:38.948 --> 00:02:41.760
It became a bit overwhelming
with over nausea and vomiting.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.450
and.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.610
You know so that
was not very fun

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.090
quite.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.040
Costs a lot of
stress and anxiety

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:48.187
i guess as well.

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:49.170
And

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.020
when you have a little
bleedes in the first trimester or

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.246
and you know

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.809
things that seem to be normal

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.040
are still very scary

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.230
it's just all the hormones
in your body and.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.849
You

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.960
i think also

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.440
your mind is trying to comprehend
that you're making a person

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.961
so the first trimester
can bring all sorts of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.310
conflicting emotions.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.130
The number one thing
the first trimester brings the

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:13.290
is is this baby going to.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.840
Survive and will miscarry.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.800
Cause really until after women get to about
twelve weeks that tends to be one of the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.403
number one things
that they think about.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:26.452
I took out on my husband and i remember
because we don't have any family here so he

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.920
was the only person 
around me that i could..

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.300
I.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.800
Get it all out.

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:34.020
we both going through a
lot of changes we were..

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.360
Starting a family
together it was..

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.640
a massive things
for the both of us and.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.440
I think emotionally

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.880
for both of us it was a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.510
quite

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.763
a challenging time.

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:45.428
you have all these thoughts about..

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.740
Am i going to be a good parent

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.726
am i going to be able
to provide for this child

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.340
financially, emotionally,
physically.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.436
So it was it was very exciting but also
the same time the bit scary.

00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.600
it's normal for mothers
and fathers to go through

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.900
periods of feeling

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.380
really positive and
and a little bit down

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.078
but if you're not
dragging yourself out of a

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:06.951
a dark period over a
period of a week or so

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.088
and it feels like it's getting worse and
you having those negative thoughts..

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:11.320
please seek help.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.264
I spoke to a lot of midwives about the
emotions that i was feeling..

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.925
i found that..

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.910
They're fantastic cause they were..

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.780
Very very good i didn't have my
husband and there I thought

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.950
that that was again

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:24.510
a time that we could have.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.030
Me time so i could go in there and and just
let out everything they'd love, so it was..

00:04:30.328 --> 00:04:31.500
it was very good so..

00:04:33.114 --> 00:04:35.112
If you have got a good
relationship with your doctor

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:37.175
you can definitely go and speak
to your gp-(General Practitioner).

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.090
it's probably worth
while i'm talking to..

00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.100
first time moms, but another
good option these days is there's alot of

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.790
groups on Facebook so you can..

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.402
Talk about your thoughts
and feelings online.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.082
you probably felt more than i did.

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.760
I did not feel much different.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.450
Yeah

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.720
i didn't feel like a father

00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:53.937
It wasn't there yet.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.227
yeah.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.750
generally in the first trimester
there's that realization you're pregnant..

00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:02.174
and what does this mean for your life
what does this mean for you as a couple.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.490
When it's just been the two of
you, especially if it's your first baby.

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:08.640
If it's not your first baby you're
starting to think, what am i..

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.060
how's this going to impact on
the other child that's here.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.693
You know i love this
child so completely

00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:17.548
am i going to have the
capacity to love another child

00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:19.110
so they all really normal thoughts.

00:05:19.134 --> 00:05:21.134
