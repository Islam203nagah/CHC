00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:01.890
In the second trimester, women..

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.043
Are probably focusing
a little bit more on..

00:00:04.068 --> 00:00:05.776
the fact that they
actually having a baby

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.390
to thinking about things like you know
what rooms the baby going to go into.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.580
What kind of mum am i going to be

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.089
they've started to perhaps
do antenatal classes

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:15.900
so they getting a little
bit more information.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.246
They're getting to know
their health provider hopefully,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.860
and getting more
and more informed

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.190
and they started to have conversations
with mothers and sisters and

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.613
and other friends about birth which they
may not have had those conversations in the

00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:27.993
first twelve weeks.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.050
Cause some women want to
kind of keep the pregnancy quiet.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.350
The nausea generally eases off.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.536
The sense of tiredness can ease
women often feel much better

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.177


00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.140
and they feel much
more pregnant.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.160
Women said to start to
feel quite glowing and.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.530
Generally it's probably
the most healthy

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.070
and.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
And wellest.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.100
Period during pregnancy.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.403
The hormones are
settling

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.110
more in the second
trimester and it was

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.572
it's like it's the time that you
actually start enjoying the pregnancy.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.980
you stop feeling the baby
move for the first time, and..

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:04.138
You know you start getting a
few of those flutters and kicks and..

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.784
You know

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.107
i guess for the first few times you
think is that the baby or is that gas

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.054


00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.691
and.

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:13.448
But eventually realize it's the baby
and then that's really exciting.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.960
just physical changes like..

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.830
my boobs just were getting bigger
and starting to get a bit sore

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.190
and.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.317
I found that my nails and my hair was
growing a lot more on a lot quicker.

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.210
one thing for me my i could feel my hips

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.427
and my ribs starting to widen, so i started
to stretch in the middle of the night.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.798
Off the wall cause
of my ribs really hurt

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.725
she did keep on vomiting.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.050
But now her body shape
was actually changing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.180
which was perfect
because i think ..

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.540
you begin to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.996
form somewhat of an
attachment to the fetus

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.965
because you see that
there is a belly there.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.913
the biggest physical changes for me

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.950
were starting to show and just.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.339
Clothes that i'm used to wearing
they were getting a lot tighter.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.580
it was a struggle to.

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:57.410
you know

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
kinda like.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640
Feel.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.279
As good as i wanted to

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:04.575
I think the best thing you can
do is to feel good about yourself

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.512
is to buy maternity clothes
like buy clothes that..

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.009
will lend to the changes in your body and
you can put your favorite Jeans away

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:13.289
and just accept that.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.056
That's not the time for them now and
then embrace the change.

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:21.450
physical symptoms that you might
need to go and seek help about.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.490
For example

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.643
you know if you have severe headaches, if
you have spot in front of your eyes,

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:27.800
if you suddenly get a lot of swelling

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.130
It's important to make sure that
your blood pressure hasn't gone up.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.370
any bleeding.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.430
Again you should
you should seek help

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.777
but other than that

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.492
you know, all the general aches and
pains that you get during pregnancy

00:02:39.517 --> 00:02:40.760
are usually quite normal.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.530
During the second trimester there's
i guess what we call a settling into it.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.450
You're starting to look pregnant

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.356
you started to feel less sick
sometimes you feel less tired

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.230
you've usually come to terms with it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.255
it's a time when often
you will have an ultrasound done.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.639
that'll tell you that everything's
okay with the baby.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.800
So you tend to relax into it
and start to really think about..

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
Becoming a mum

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.571
and society out there is starting to recognize
you're pregnant and and they're reinforcing it.

00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:10.977
during that second trimester i felt i was
able to control myself a lot more emotionally

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.610
i really made sure
and it was really.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.595
Pushed on me by the
midwives and also by..

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.350
My family i really wanted to
take care of myself if that was..

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.690
Going to get a
message, if that was..

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.990
going shopping by myself
for a little bit, if that was..

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:29.330
Just going to
the movies going.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.460
To dinner with my
girlfriends it was.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.230
During that time.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.660
I needed to make
sure that i was happy

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.070
i think the only negative emotions i
had was in relation to the body image.

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:43.400
You know so that and the
ongoing vomiting.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.320
You know i think i felt pretty..

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.620
And because I've never have
had a baby everyone would tell me

00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:50.540
it'll be worth it
it'll be worth it, but..

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.515
there was probably times where i thought
is it really going to be worth it

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.325
cause i feel so terrible, and
i felt so terrible for so long.

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:58.100
There was some exhaustion as well.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.920
Because she was always
throwing up so she couldn't

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.580
she couldn't do anything else which meant
that i had to step up looking after her.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.050
And.

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:10.490
I think at some point i became, 
I was emotionally exhausted

00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:12.033
which wasn't fair because

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:16.170
you know, we did this together so
why should she carry the burden of..

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.240
Of you know..

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.170
having all the vomiting and the physical
changes, and i'm just the observer

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.320
it's really important that
men also find that support

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.860
so they may be in an environment
where nobody has children.

00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:29.597
None of the their..

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.220
Siblings may have had children

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.880
so it's important also for dads to
get that support and that network

00:04:35.162 --> 00:04:36.620
The support that i
received was great

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.290
because you do a midwife
clinic at the hospital, so..

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:44.330
Depending again when you might have care
you lay to see your private doctor..

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.050
you could end up seeing them fortnightly
or monthly but you can go there and share..

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.130
Any feelings anything that you
going through the midwives will..

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.315
generally ask you
set questions.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.272
If i felt like i ever needed
help i would go seek help

00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:57.290
and.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.170
It was always my first
priority just to make sure..

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.640
My health and mental state of mind especially
during my pregnancy was at its best

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.930
yes, you know your pregnant in the
first trimester and it's all very exciting..

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.410
but until you say that bump
for you get that first kick it's not..

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.479
for me it wasn't inherently real

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.890
i think the reality of..

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.790
Adjusting to being a parent actually hit
me in the second trimester to be honest.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.660
Where..

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.140
I mean..

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.255
We've basically been in a
relationship with each other

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.129
 looking after each other's needs.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.210
Throughout the period that
the time we were together

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.690
but now that she was -you know-
 about to have a baby.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.820
You know you start
thinking about oh

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.690
look we need

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.040
probably need more money

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.370
you know she's probably going to be
out of work for that period of time well.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.440
He's still an infant baby.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.574
So we started thinking about
what we need to get and..

00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:49.190
and we did just after
the second trimester start..

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.960
getting everything ready.
