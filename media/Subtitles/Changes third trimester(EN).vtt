00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.640
So in the last trimester women
will often again feel a bit more tired.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.580
They'll be more likely to get
things like an aching back.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.549
Indigestion is more
common in the last trimester.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:14.522
Cramps in in the
calf for example.

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:15.878
are more common

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.310
and generally women will be moving slower
and needing a little bit more rest

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.640
the reflux started, and the
shortness of breath started, and..

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.340
The fatigue came
back a little bit and the..

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.830
Night waking changed

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:33.900
I was up a lot needing the bathroom
and you know,those sorts of things

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
i was planning on
working up until four weeks.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.170
Before my due date and
i think i stopped at around

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320
eight.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.730
Before

00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:42.878
eight weeks before my due date

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:43.620
just because..

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.700
I was so big , i was finding myself
to be really really uncomfortable.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.120
Also during that
time i was quite..

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.910
insecure about the way i was feeling.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.250
And just being so big and..

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.410
also being so young like..

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.220
I didn't

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.460
feel like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.550
twenty one year old
should feel at that time

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.080
i really liked the third trimester

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.500
just.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.360
She was she's not throwing up.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.730
She was definitely

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.970
you know bigger

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200
but i.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.070
I thought she looked
she was glowing she is really

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.190
beautiful at the time

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
your appointments at the hospital start
to increase so you go from monthly to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.000
fortnightly to wakely they start to do more
tests so you may have diabetes check you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
might have ..

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.640
More blood tests, you might have..

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.150
What's called a..

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.970
group strep b test.

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:32.405
And that's normally 
the last couple of weeks

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.178
the movement of the baby's really important
that we now know that the mother's the

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.900
best judge of that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.343
so if your baby's be moving fantastically
and then suddenly it's moving a lot less

00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:42.030
and you're worried.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.274
Never ignore it,

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.210
always ask a health professional.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.450
Cause your baby's movements are
the best indicator the babie's well

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.700
a lot of the thoughts in
the third trimester around.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.710
The birth winding up work.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.056
You've been working
woman perhaps all your life

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.120
 and now suddenly
that identity is changing

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
that can be very confronting for
some women and they really go through..

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.298
A sense of grief and what will their
identity be in the future

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.458
 it was that whole..

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.929
Me comparing myself to other people

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.538
and like my pregnancy compared to
other people's pregnancies

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.000
that i really really
struggled with

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.870
the other thing women often during
the last trimester which is very sweet.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.980
is nest

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.080
and if you don't nest,
don't get anxious either

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.190
because some women

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.499
go through it all and don't
give it another thought.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.870
It's kind of the
wind up phase before..

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.040
Before you've got to really
look after someone else so..

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.410
It's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.906
it's a hard time because

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.491
cause while you think you're ready

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:36.464
you're never going to be
ready untill it's there

00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:40.920
it was very very draining
during the.. Last trimester it was.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.540
Organizing the baby shower making sure
you know we had creams, wraps.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.120
It was all of that and your mind is just
continuously going a thousand miles an hour

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.363
i had some good friends that..

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.841
Have had babies previously and..

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.750
A friend that had a baby
a few months before

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.530
and.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.290
I had Austin and so that
would really good cause

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:03.690
i would understand those
feelings that i was having

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.910
just being ready for
the baby to come and..

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
You know.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.950
And.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.340
Understanding how
uncomfortable it's and..

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.950
also about some of
the expectations and..

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.583
apprehensions i guess about..

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.489
looking after a newborn

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.216
family and friends are really important
when you're pregnant because especially..

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:25.440
emotionally because you can share feelings
it's also a good time when a lot of girls

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.000
will have the baby shower or oh.

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.333
You know you can catch up with friends

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:31.400
I found it incredible to have that support

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.100
not of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.330
not only of my family but of
a lot of my friends and even..

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.520
Some of Eric's friends as well

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.120
I'll often say that the largest
organ involved in childbirth is the brain.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.583
So we have to address it a lot
and we have to support women a lot

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:47.920
I found at the end of the
pregnancy

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.700
it's like your body just
kicks into something and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.540
you don't even care, for me i was like
i don't even care i just want this baby out

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
that was actually really good shift because
then i stopped becoming scared i guess if

00:03:58.983 --> 00:03:59.670
the birth

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.130
and more excited that yup.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.100
He was coming out and i was
going to get to meet him at the end.
