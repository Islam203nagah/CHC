There are many techniques
for settling your baby.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.450
Listening to other parents
advice can be helpful

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.320
but remember that every baby is different
and what works for someone else may not

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
work for you.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.435
William's six weeks old

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.860
when we first came out of hospital
we had no idea what we're doing

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.070
and what would work with him
and what would not work with him

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
i mean i guess.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.123
We still don't really know what
we're doing is right.

00:00:28.148 --> 00:00:30.057
or what we're doing is wrong

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.543
We're at least now
learning what works with him

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:34.003
and what doesn't work with him.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.758
So..

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.160
to try settle him.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:38.130
talking and..

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
going shh..

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.600
shh..

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.010
Shh..

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160
Perfect.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.660
Cornelius is only really started to respond
to our settling techniques in the past

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.860
week being six weeks old

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.930
he has a lot of whims
he loves being put

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.560
on his tummy initially and rub his back and
as soon as he stops crying flip him over

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.680
and then patting his head and
then just rubbing his tummy as well

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.690
really seem to
settle him down and.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.790
We find as soon
as he stops crying

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.980
to stop doing anything
and just leave him to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.463
to sort of settle himself

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:12.335
there's no one thing ,
just keep trying different things

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.320
and you think you've got
him worked out one minute.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.586
And then it doesn't work and
you gonna to try something new

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:19.606
we were walking around in circles

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:21.205
so it was kind of a
bit of a rhythm to it.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.744
we've got a little water feature..

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.668
out in our backyard..

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:27.522
a little fountain

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.210
And the noise of that
seems to work quite well ..

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.826
but then again it
won't work every time.

00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.350
And we've got a cd that she really likes.

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:39.912
So ,we'd Play that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.797
and that could work.

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:43.404
rocking, patting,..

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.065
A lot of singing and making
up songs with her name

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.027
and sometimes it's bath
,maybe a bath would work.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.700
taking her outside into a park

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
Also realizing that sometimes when she
hasn't settled after a period of time

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.870
to possibly..

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.670
Leave it alone for awhile.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.290
and get the stress levels down.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.303
She keeps on building up, and
she kinda get louder and louder and.

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:08.620
so the things you're doing aren't working.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.290
I think it's just not to panic

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.505
something eventually will work.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.280
she eventually will stop crying.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.750
Nice sweetheart.
