00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.770
Down syndrome is a chromosome abnormality

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.970
It happens at conception.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.100
And there is no fault of anyone.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.720
It's where an extra chromosome
on the twenty first chromosome.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.610
One of the things to remember.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.420
Is that the child will have
forty six chromosomes.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:23.039
That would have had anyhow it
just has one additional chromosome.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.640
So the child is a
combination of its parents like

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.240
like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.680
it's brothers and sisters.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.160
The fact that has an extra
chromosome he's going to give

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.230
the child a few
additional features

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
of somebody else with down
syndrome but it doesn't mean.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.556
That that child is gone to look like
every other child with down syndrome

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.650
The child would look
like his or her family

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.360
so children with down syndrome.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.820
Invariably have

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.680
a number of features including

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.720
facial features.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
And.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.590
Have intellectual disability.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.320
As a result of the
effects of having three

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.180
copies of chromosome twenty one

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.740
on the developing brain

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.360
about half will have

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.240
a problem with the heart,and
the way the heart develops.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.907
Some will have under

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.130
activity of the thyroid gland.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.070
Occasionally they can
be blockage in the bowls

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.810
when a child down syndrome is born

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.020
The medical machine
goes into overdrive

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.780
and they taste for
everything as they should.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.490
But that doesn't mean that your life is
going to be full of medical appointments

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.740
it is just for that
initial period.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.960
Of checking everything
that they should

00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:32.238
the heart.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.240
The hearing

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.680
the bowls

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.801
all those things.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.620
Once they're ticked a off.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.410
It doesn't mean your
life is going to be.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.300
Leaving at the doctor's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.570
my name's Katie.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.480
I have three kids.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.709
And my eldest Taylor who is
seven and a half has down syndrome.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.150
My name is Dona

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.630
and.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
I have.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.030
My husband and i have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110
five children

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.800
and Charlie who has
down syndrome is our fourth child

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.030
When the families in
hospital with a new baby.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.250
It can feel to them often that.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.730
Like they have given birth to a
diagnosis rather than to a baby.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.390
So we make a big..

00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:14.790
Issue of the fact that they have had a
baby and that baby should be celebrated

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.430
cause the baby's
born not a diagnosis

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.280
after birth most children
with down syndrome

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.253
can be treated and exactly
the same way as any other child

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.712
They can be breastfeed.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.310
they can be with their mother

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.470
children can go
home with their parents

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.704
bond and..

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.310
Settle into the
routine of the family.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.418
So finding out that your
child has down syndrome

00:02:35.443 --> 00:02:37.590
can be quite a shock
for parents especially

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.340
if people haven't learned that
during the pregnancy and had time

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.460
to come to terms with it
before the birth of a child.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.450
And.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.230
Parents often find it very
helpful to come into contact

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.840
with the local
Down syndrome association

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.900
who can provide enormous
support and help

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.380
and they can find
help from family, friends

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.300
from the local doctor.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.256
They might.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.300
Be referred for
can see if that's.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.610
Helpful for those individuals.

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:06.941
Most people.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.920
Think that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.310
that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.580
having a child with
a disability is going

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.130
has ruined their life and
the life plans but that's.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.530
That's not the case
that never the case.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.570
It might slightly

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.340
Take you to another path.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.150
But that's actually
a really good path.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.389
One of the difficulties of my job is trying
to explain to families when they're in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.530
often such a state of grief
that life won't be like that.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.640
Forever.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.120
It he's just a period of grief
unfortunately they have to go through.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.740
And trying to explain to them all the
wonders that this child like any child.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.510
Is gone to bring to thier life.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.170
Early on.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.620
I would've probably thought.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.240
What if I
Can't love this child.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.340
Particularly when you think

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.250
how can i get excited
about a child who..

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.230
Is not going to be able to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.210
to do something

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360
as simple as.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.940
Tie their shoelaces

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.860
how can i get excited about..

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.410
But you know what you do

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.590
you get excited

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.340
now because they've been
able to achieve something.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.270
That..

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.350
Okay maybe your other
kids did do a lot earlier

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.030
but they still get there

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.010
and that's the important thing

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.200
He can be a very
loving little boy.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.740
He will be just running
around the room doing his thing

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.490
and he would just come over
to give me a quick cuddle.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.000
And he goes mum

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.805
and then after a few runs again.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.360
He just comes in
for these sort of ..

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.200
a top up

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.470
if you like.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.500
Of the fiction and
off he goes again

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.350
which is really nice to
see that he wants that interaction.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.820
So..

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.287
that sort of tops me up and.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.480
We can do this.
We can keep going.
